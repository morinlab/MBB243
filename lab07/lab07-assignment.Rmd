## Assignment

### Highest and lowest death rates

The WHO wants to know, of the countries that have \>10,000 cases, which one has the highest death rate and which one has the lowest death rate to better understand the health care systems of some countries. Create a code chunk in this Markdown file to load in the required data and manipulate it to determine this information. Your code should separately set a variable to store the number 10000 so that the WHO can easily adjust that threshold in your code snippet instead of coming back to you to ask the same question.

### In Europe, cumulative cases by countries

Some media outlets want to get the cumulative cases in 2020 of different countries in Europe. In a second code chunk, create a snippet of code to get this answer and store 'Europe' in a separate variable. That way their analysts can simply change the variable to get information about other continents, avoiding mistakes resulting in erroneous reporting.
